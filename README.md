# Pizza House
Project on Node.js & MongoDB. Uses the templates to generate the html pages and implements http methods.
Three main routes: authenticaion, admin(to manage pizzas, create, update and delete, see users info) and home(user mode, to register/login, make orders and see the history or orders).
Sessions used to keep the user registered during the switching between different pages.
